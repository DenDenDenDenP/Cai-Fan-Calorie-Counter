# General Assembly Capstone Project
 The Capstone project is the final project for the Data Analytics Immersive and it is the culmination of what i have learnt at GA.

 I have decided to apply my newfound knowledge to create web application, "Cai Fan Calorie Counter" (Pre-production).

Problem Statement
Expensive Healthy Meal
Eating healthy in Central Business District (CBD) is expensive and the average price of the healthy meal is $10 which might be not sustainable for frugal worker.
Lack calorie information for economic choice
Economic rice also known as Cai Fan is the wallet-friendly option for frugal workers to have their meal in CBD but there is lack of calorie information to make healthy choice.
